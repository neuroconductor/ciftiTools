Description: CIFTI files contain brain imaging data in "grayordinates,"
        which represent the gray matter as cortical surface vertices
        (left and right) and subcortical voxels (cerebellum, basal
        ganglia, and other deep gray matter). 'ciftiTools' provides a
        unified environment for reading, writing, visualizing and
        manipulating CIFTI-format data. It supports the "dscalar,"
        "dlabel," and "dtseries" intents. Grayordinate data is read in
        as a "xifti" object, which is structured for convenient access
        to the data and metadata, and includes support for surface
        geometry files to enable spatially-dependent functionality such
        as static or interactive visualizations and smoothing.
